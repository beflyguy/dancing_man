# The Man that Dances to Anything
Learning PIL/imageio by manipulating GIF files to go along to music.

### The Story
My brother showed me a gif that apparently danced to the beat of any song. It worked pretty well, but I realized that I could customize how the gif looked and it's speed to actually go along with the song. With this thought came the creation of this project.

### How it Works (Currently)
Running the program, you'll encounter a couple color inputs to change certain attributes of the dancing man. Finally, you'll input the BPM of the song he'll be dancing to. Then, it'll change the gif's colors and speed to match the song.

### Future Features
Ideally, I plan to integrate the Spotify API to figure out what I'm listening to, grab the metadata on the song, and immediately change the gif's attributes as it's playing. This program could be used as a transparent overlay on a stream, in which I intend to use it.
